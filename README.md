## About  
A concise, powerful library implementing core linear algebra constructs — **Vector**, **Matrix**, and associated operations — designed for clarity, performance, and extensibility.

---

## Features  
- Fully implemented `Vector` and `Matrix` classes supporting:
  - Arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
  - Dot, cross product, determinant, trace, eigenvalues (where applicable)
  - Identity, zero, diagonal matrix creation  
- Intuitive API with operator overloading and methods like `.dot()`, `.det()`  
- Pythonic: clean, maintainable, and documented code  
- Built-in examples and tests for all major functionalities
